An Immersive Video app for the Apple Vision Pro

This app plays an immersive video companion experience for issue 5 of my [zine](https://michaelverdi.com/zine/). It's a fork of the [OpenImmersive app](https://github.com/acuteimmersive/openimmersive) by [Anthony MaÃ«s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/portemantho/) ([Acute Immersive](https://acuteimmersive.com/)), derived from [Spatial Player](https://github.com/mikeswanson/SpatialPlayer/) by [Mike Swanson](https://blog.mikeswanson.com/).
